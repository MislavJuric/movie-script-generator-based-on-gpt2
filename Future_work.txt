 - generating the movie scripts without HTML markup and/or blank lines and fine-tune the model on that dataset
 - longer fine-tuning
 - different prompt structures
 - different parameters when generating the text (I only experimented with **top_k**)
 - if this model were to be deployed in production, it would need output parsing (since the output from the model is in one line and contains HTML markup)
