Behind them, we see a big poster advertising a show-up against the water. There is a photo of the gang and their dead body on the poster. There is also a photo of Jayne's dead girlfriend. A banner over the poster reads, "BIG CHRONIC TEAR SHOW." We see Jayne and an alien-looking alien man walking over to the poster. He is holding a gun in both hands. <b> JAYNE </b> You think she's alive? He looks down at the alien, but doesn't understand. <b> JAYNE </b> She's dead, right?

Jayne turns and starts walking toward the group. <b> ALIEN </b> Don't get carried away. I'm sure we can help her. <b> JAYNE </b> Who are you? <b> ALIEN </b> It's a small, alien-looking thing, actually. Its intelligence is still refined. It's still the best specimens we have. <b> JAYNE </b> What do you know about these guys? <b> ALIEN </b> The aliens are real smart and ruthless. They're probably vegetarians, or something. I don't know if they live or die. But I've read of them. They eat only from large, low loads of meat and dairy. <b> JAYNE </b> Where am I? <b> ALIEN </b> On the surface. In the Spirit Ship. They're the closest surviving alien to Earth. There are two other cities that are very similar to theirs. When you've lived to tell me, that would be okay. <b> JAYNE </b> I just want to know what's going on, so I can find out what's really going on. We both know we have skeletons in our spaceship, but this isn't the first place I'm going to find someone who hasn't been there. <b> ALIEN </b> If you were alone when I first met you, you could have been killed by the Alien, too.

He didn't say that. He just said that. He didn't know that I would bring him back. I know that I could. I know that I am destined to come home someday. The light in the rock can't come to this place.

MILITARY BASE - NIGHT </b> We are inside the headquarters. A group of young soldiers huddled with their eyes open. A GENERAL speaks to the General. <b> GENERAL </b> The King will be defeated. Only he will oppose you with his faith. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> By faith? It is a false assumption. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> Yes, Father Perrault. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> Of course you can tell me the truth of man. A King without sword does not know the power to oppose him, but he knows that he must take his sword. The General stares at the parchment. It looks like the last letter of the King's address. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> We must now move on to the other side of that text. <b> INT. MILITARY BASE - DAY </b> The General and his officers are standing together, conferring. <b> GENERAL </b> Now, if you'll excuse us, General, we have a much to discuss.

They look at each other for a long moment. <b> LIEUTENANT </b> This is no place for the Senate to discuss your concerns. But we have not yet begun.

Our soldiers will not hesitate, and we will use that army to REPEACH the city. We will not bow and bend for the lives of our entire people. <b> LIEUTENANT </b> I understand, General. But you must leave this city for good. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> How can you do that? The nobles exchange a glance. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> By force, in your own interest, I ask the nobles to do so. <b> LIEUTENANT </b> Why? <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> Because we are about to WARP. And this is a very unpopular opinion. The nobles exchange a look, and the General walks over to a door. He pulls out a sword and extends it to the Lieutenant. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> Hold this. The Lieutenant hands the sword to the General. <b> LIEUTENANT </b> Your Majesty. <b> GENERAL OF ARMORY </b> As I knew King Louis XIII would not go to war, we slowly, secretly, respect our king.

She takes a couple of steps, her eyes shining with tears. <b> MUMMUD </b> I am not leaving. He pulls his long gown down over his shoulders. A very intense look falls over them. <b> KING </b> Yes, Mumbles, the time is right. He kisses her again. Then, Mumbles, eyes glowing, pulls away from the King. <b> MUMMUD </b> I am a little disappointed in you, son. The King has no reaction. He lets her go. Mumbles walks through the courtyard and into the garden. <b> MUMMUD </b> You were very kind to him. I wish for the best in all, but I've never given him my gratitude. He is not to be trusted. He walks in the garden with the waves of his hands. <b> MUMMUD </b> He will protect me. I must learn to live like a man. Mumbles stares into the sunlight. <b> MUMMUD </b> I am lost, and sometimes I do not wish the King a father. A few moments pass, and the sun disappears. Then, it rises on the sky. <b>INT.

As well as many stairs, however, are at the top of the circular stairway. The center of the pyramid is dominated by the foot of a huge, black stairway that runs down the opposite end of the room. The stairway itself has been closed off by the heavy furniture and black spray paint that covers it. No one can hear anything through the shuttered door and no one can see through the heavy, paint-splattered curtains. All the time, during the silent silent following, there is the sound of a dog barking. It is the first of a sudden, raspy sound in the world.

He reaches down and runs, trying to reach the door to the other level. There is a second, more echoing sound, which also keeps coming, and then continues, until the boy is gone.

Immediately, a sound of panic. The men, lit only by their shoes and the wet paint that cover the walls, are all panicked. They turn around to see who is following, but all that is left of the two men are just a few feet away. They're all standing on one of the stairways leading to the top of the stairway. It is pitch black and the dogs, still on the ground, are almost still barking. The dog, who is about ten, comes closer, panting. The sound of the dogs gets closer and closer, but a few seconds pass before the men stop. The second dog runs from the steps, then ADVENTURE | from behind a third, and some seconds later, it's heard again, barking. The sound of the screeching dogs is very similar to the one that came out of the stairwell in the last place, and the same, but from different angles, seems to have changed direction. The third and fourth, walking through the shadows, have found another area. They are covered in the same thin, heavy raincoat and are lying in the grass on each other's feet, apart from each other, facing each other, against each other's bodies. They are both breathing heavily, but, for some reason, the noises in this scene seem to be close to the noise in the room. The three men rise and get on their feet. They start to walk, and they all halt, as though afraid, and sit up. Suddenly the men look around for something, and begin to walk towards them. Only now do they realize that the other three men have stopped and are staring directly at them. The third man has his arm around the two remaining men and the fourth man is holding his bleeding hand towards his own forehead. The dog he brought down from the stairs, who is still barking incessantly, is also running

This is a very strange place. Several members of the crowd have reached the door. They are all in their seats, standing over the desk, facing the entrance. One of the uniformed officers looks at them with a look of terror in his eyes. The second officer reaches for his gun, and points it at the door.

He steps back as the door opens and another light comes on. <b> WOMAN'S BEDROOM </b> The rustling sound now echoing. He creeps forward, his eyes settling on... <b> WOMAN'S BEDROOM </b> It's a small affair, so dark. The floor is carpeted with floor mats, cushions, and sheets. But the rug has been completely pulled out. A man, holding a lightbulb, appears through the bathroom doorway. He's wearing a dark blue suit, with his hands tied behind his back. He holds the lightbulb at his side and stares, when suddenly... A muffled explosion.

COMEDY | irectly in front of him is a small, black glass apparatus. It is a machine designed to control the movement of the water at liquid-level. This device is known as a "water port." There are hundreds of sensors that are wired to it, operated by a small, wired-to-the- environment machine. Once the control is complete, the water port slowly lowers, slowly lowering. As the pressure increases, the glass sphere will slowly lower, until it is level with the crystalline floor. This is known as the "V." <b> SPHINX </b> (in awe) This is the real thing... <b> ZAPHOD </b> Yes, it is... The ship is about ten meters wide. Half the atmosphere in the room will be contained inside a glass sphere. All of this will in turn produce tremendous heat and tremendous electromagnetic pulse that will spread throughout the ship. The glass sphere will slow at about 5 meters per second. Splashing is impossible, even impossible in an underground sea. Suddenly, in the sphere itself, a huge mass of blue-white LIQUID oozes out of the ice. Startling in its container is a giant, green laser light. The blue laser light spreads quickly across the ice. <b> ZAPHOD </b> See this. The laser light spins, and penetrates the cylinder in its container, splitting open the cylinder in two halves. The water in the sphere begins to pour out, and disappears. As the blue light hits the ice in the sphere, it also dissolves into fiery pieces. <b> ANGLE ON ZAPHOD </b> For a moment he is frozen.

It's a miracle. <b> PICARD </b> It's great to be safe here... <b> KLUTE </b> Let's get the hell out of here. <b> PICARD </b> I'm a captain. If we're going to stay this ship, we need to keep moving. <b> KIRK </b> Sir, we have no time to argue. All of a sudden the ship's engines go out in a series of sputters, then stalls. <b> JIMMY PIG </b> They'll stop! All engines go out! Jimmy Pig turns away in disgust. <b> KIRK </b> Aw, crap. I didn't even know that ship had half a minute to stop. (to Kirk) Jim, you okay? <b> KIRK </b> I'm all right. <b> JIMMY PIG </b> Can't you get past the fact that there's a giant, silent ship in the sky that's going to die? Everyone stops what they are doing. <b> HECK </b> We're not going to die here. Kirk lets this sink in. <b> KIRK </b> You mean you want to tell us why? <b> HECK </b> I mean, in the old days, everyone thought they were the dumbest ship in the world, but now they're all scared. I mean, the damn thing's dead! Kirk lets this sink in. He notices the tiny control panels that still hold his station. <b> HECK </b> Look, Kirk... this thing hasn't failed. We've been sent up here for three years-- <b> KIRK </b> --Three years-- <b> HECK </b> We've been sent up for three years-- <b> KIRK </b> --and four years. <b> HECK </b> That's not good. <b> KIRK </b> You really think we should be stuck here all this time? Why are we all here? Why are we being sent up here and being scared? <b> HECK </b> Maybe because we are stupid, Jim. Because we never will be stupid-- <b> JIMMY PIG </b> All right, all right, go ahead, but ask questions. Jim sits before Kirk and starts to ask questions. <b> JIMMY PIG </b> Are we really still friends? Are we the only friends in the whole ship? Are we really still friends? Jim stops.

COMEDY | </b> (continuing; nervous) Of course not-- <b> KIRK </b> Because of us? We may be friends but we're not the only friends in the entire ship. We might even be the only one who will ever be the friendliest ship in the whole world. I'm going to ask them. <b> HECK </b> I'm going to ask them now, Jim. I'll tell them the truth, and tell them that I was right. Jimmy nods. A beat. Kirk realizes he doesn't have to. Finally: <b> KIRK </b> What do you think? I feel like an idiot. <b> HECK </b> (jumping in) You're not an idiot, son. Kirk, this is serious. Do you want to get serious? You better start thinking of the consequences of the second century being avoided. <b> KIRK </b> I can't. I'm trying to go home. <b> HECK </b> Then you'll want to try and tell me why you're here, too. If you do, we may not be friends but we're not the only friends in this ship. And for all this you were ordered to die, right? <b> KIRK </b> For all this, I'm not going to die. Kirk stands up. <b> KIRK </b> Please. Just let me have my life. I have an eternity of life. He stands there in silence, as if he knew that he might experience some kind of crisis. Then: <b> HECK </b> You're going to try and tell me what it is you want to do. <b> KIRK </b> What do you want to do? <b> HECK </b> First of all, you don't have to tell me. Second, even if you tried to shoot your brother, the price of surrendering your life would still be the same. We're all mortal, okay? <b> KIRK </b> Uh, but-- <b> HECK </b> (frowning) Just trust me. He steps closer, and KIRK gets the hint. <b> KIRK </b> You don't even know what that means. <b> HECK </b> Just trust me. I'll see you on the landing site. And you and me, we'll be all together. But right now, if that's all you've got to do, then that's all anyone's got. <b> KIRK </b> I've got my life up to my shoulders, I swear. And I'm not going to let you die.

COMEDY | You see I'm not going to let you die. <b> HECK </b> (smiling) Okay, let it happen. And while you may not have seen it in me, I'm going to have you back on the force, and I'm going to get off on this alone for about a week. <b> KIRK </b> I gotta get off at the end of the month. <b> HECK </b> You've never been far, Kirk, I'm surprised. But let me tell you, I've got work to do. He moves toward the door and out. The moment passes. Kirk turns back. <b> CUT TO: </b> <b> 125 EXT. STREET - DUSK </b> Kirk walking home from work. He stops. He looks up and down the street, not looking at the street or the street or the house. He runs his hand through his hair. <b> CUT TO: </b> <b> 126 EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT </b> Kirk walks alone, not looking at himself in the sun. A long, dark silence. He looks at his watch. <b> 128 EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT </b> Kirk watches the night. He starts walking. The lonely, empty desert. <b> CUT TO: </b> <b> 129 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO SKYLINE - DUSK </b> Kirk walks down a twisting, twisting road in San Francisco. He pauses. No one is there. He walks a few yards and stops. He watches. The skyline of San Francisco is still only a quarter of a mile away, overhanging from the sea, the faint glow of a summer afternoon sun. Kirk doesn't stop walking because -- The desert reaches the top of a distant rise. It is a long, stunningly steep hill-side. Beyond is the entire Pacific. There is no point in wandering around like that for a moment. All that can be seen are the mountains, the empty plain walls and the swaying jutting rock. Kirk begins walking, his hands clasped in front of him, moving his arms in front of him, as though not aware of the landscape. His head resting on his hands, he feels the silence and the soft soft strains of rock playing in his ears. In the distance, he sees the ocean. And the city. His fingers reach out toward the horizon, the soft wind driving off an almost ethereal beauty.

COMEDY | And then, the sound of a distant horn. Kirk freezes. The horn. Kirk runs along the horizon, stopping only to stare out at the sea. From behind the hill, a tiny FIGURE rockets out into the setting sun. And the FIGURE continues on as though looking in Kirk's direction. The FIGURE stands at the horizon, looking at Kirk, and Kirk stops. The FIGURE turns and looks over his shoulder at Kirk. <b> FIGURE </b> You said you didn't want to go out in public. A moment of silence. <b> FIGURE </b> That's true. You know who they are... The FIGURE raises the gun, aims at Kirk. <b> FIGURE </b> No, I'm telling you. I wasn't there. You don't know how I could be there. <b> KIRK </b> That's bullshit. <b> FIGURE </b> They're human. When we're human, we always get what we want. I guess we got our start in life, Kirk. And then we made the wrong choice. We decided not to run. <b> KIRK </b> Shit. Why not? There are lots of answers in here. (off his look) I can't even think of one. The FIGURE is staring back at Kirk, his face a mask of anger, sadness. He seems to have lost control. He shakes his head, tears starting to stand in his eyes. A long beat. <b> FIGURE </b> (to Kirk) Your boy's no different than us. And you, we don't. <b> KIRK </b> No? <b> FIGURE </b> You don't even trust me. She gives him a hard look, then smiles. <b> FIGURE </b> This is the kind of arrogance you follow when you care for others. You might have had a son... but not a real father. And you've let him run away before. She stares at Kirk. A long beat. <b> FIGURE </b> A father can't rule his own fate. He thinks it's all a dream... but it's not. He has no choice, either. A long beat. <b> FIGURE </b> Have you been to the forest, or what? A long beat. <b> FIGURE </b> A sacred place. That's where we belong. She reaches down, takes Kirk's hand. And they lock eyes. They hold each other, their eyes locked in a gaze that is almost childlike.

COMEDY | And Kirk breaks down, a little unsteady from that ordeal. He shakes his head. And we see the look on his face. He's lost. <b> KIRK </b> Yeah? Was that what it said? <b> FIGURE </b> You got a chance to ask it. <b> KIRK </b> Huh? <b> FIGURE </b> Just ask it. A long moment. <b> FIGURE </b> We didn't know what we were doing here. <b> KIRK </b> How do I know? She holds his eyes. <b> KIRK </b> I don't know any... she'll probably know. He squeezes her tighter. She resists. <b> KIRK </b> I don't know what I'm supposed to say. <b> FIGURE </b> You want some advice, son? A long moment. The MAN is waiting for them. <b> MAN </b> Do what you have to do, boy. You're here to protect me... <b> KIRK </b> I don't have a choice. He looks at her. A moment. Then he gets up. <b> MAN </b> (to Kirk) We're going to protect you, this time until the end. A beat. But Kirk nods. <b> MAN </b> Don't ever forget that man and us together, or I'll come after you. And we can tell by the look on his face. What might've been. And he turns, and heads out through the front door. <b> EXT. BANK - DAY </b> <b> ON KIRK </b> As he strides along the sidewalk. <b> EXT. WOODS - DAY </b> As Kirk passes a dead oak tree. Relieved, he reaches over and lifts it, looking down to see it is a hundred feet from where he saw the fire escape. <b> EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY </b> Kirk rounds the corner. Almost at the edge, his jaw sets. He watches a few people run from the bank toward the house. All heads turn, but the people that pass stop. For a moment, it's as if they're seeing nothing, but not the slightest flicker of recognition. And the feeling is mutual. She is frozen by what Kirk sees. <b> KIRK </b> Look. I'm back. It's like she is. I don't think she could have jumped out of the bank... look. <b> ON KIRK </b> His face drops. This is just the beginning. And a new place. Suddenly she isn't there.

COMEDY | <b> EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY </b> Through the front door, in the dim light of dawn, we see the front porch. Kirk steps into the shadows. <b> CUT TO: </b> <b> INT. BEDROOM - DAY </b> A small bedroom off one of the fifties. Kirk paces inside in his robe, as if he doesn't know what to say. The house is a mess. It's been stripped of his personal possessions. Stuffed posters, newspaper clippings, old photographs, old clothes, old shoes. Kirk just stands there a long beat, staring at nothing. <b> NICOLE (O.S.) </b> And? Kirk snaps the door shut. NICOLE has come in, with groceries and an umbrella from the kitchen. She stands beside the door, but he looks left and right, making sure she's there. <b> NICOLE </b> Mr. Franson, I know the feeling you left before we met. That you... <b> KIRK </b> I wouldn't trade his shoes for your socks! And I'd be very nervous if I told you I liked 'em. <b> NICOLE </b> Of course you would. <b> KIRK </b> This is your house. <b> NICOLE </b> I remember it well. But not so well. So do you. You're very much the same now. <b> KIRK </b> (pleased with himself) That was the most wonderful idea. She looks at him for a long moment, then walks over. <b> NICOLE </b> Just tell me this -- <b> KIRK </b> Where were you living... <b> NICOLE </b> I was moved. (trying to be diplomatic) Where were you --? She stops, not knowing what to say. They're alone now. <b> KIRK </b> (to himself) Yeah, uh, I thought of the whole damn thing, if I could tell. But all I got is a headache -- <b> NICOLE </b> Don't be a drip. You can tell she loves you. Kirk gives her the umbrella. She lifts the bag from the door, still smiling a little. <b> NICOLE </b> You must forgive me... You must forgive me for being so... emotional about... <b> KIRK </b> (not sure where to begin) Uh... I'm not, okay? What do you know about... <b> NICOLE </b> I used to read like your father worked on a bank here. But I'm still kind of a hard case. Yeah, I sort of hate the

Kirk nods, agreeing. <b> NICOLE </b> I'm sorry to tell you that it is a long story. And I don't want you to tell me where I am. This is my story now. I've got a long way to go. She gets into the car and starts the engine. As they drive off, we can see inside the car the small man, RONSON, has been watching them get out. <b> EXT. STREET - DAY </b> They come to a stop. <b> NICOLE </b> But, Kirk, isn't it interesting...? What's the point. If this stuff gets to the bottom, I'll never be able to be a father again. (beat) But, Kirk... what's wrong with you? <b> KIRK </b> I don't know. (beat) Maybe I don't need a father anymore. They both look at the street, all expressionless. Then: <b> NICOLE </b> So, you don't expect me to have a heart right now? The two share a look. It almost looks like a kiss. The car pulls over. <b> NICOLE </b> And what do you think of the father? Who does he think of, exactly? <b> KIRK </b> I have no idea. <b> NICOLE </b> But you could use a partner. <b> KIRK </b> A partner doesn't call to me anymore. I can go back to my apartment and we can have dinner tonight. <b> NICOLE </b> I'd appreciate that. She goes back inside the car. After a moment, he turns and walks off, leaving her standing in the street as the car pulls off. She takes a drink, and smiles sadly at Kirk. <b> INT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY </b> Kirk is on the couch playing Gameboy. We PAN up to find Nina's bare legs dangling over his left breast. We hear the SOUNDS of a man's FOOTSTEPS. Then, from across the room, we hear <b> A TELEPHONE. </b> <b> VOICE </b> (over machine) Sorry to bother you, sir. (beat) Mr. Kirk is out of town, and he's a patient of mine.

COMEDY | <b> INT. KIRK'S KITCHEN - DAY </b> Kirk is in the kitchen doing dinner. In the background is Nina. Suddenly, his hand drags something from the back. The fingers slip. <b> NINA </b> Oh my God! Is that your son? A smile. He looks at her, a little confused. Nina pinches his cheek. <b> NINA </b> I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that. I just meant that if someone like that happens to me, I can't ever let him do that again. I'll lose it. <b> KIRK </b> What have I done to your son? <b> NINA </b> Nothing. Just nothing. Now, you just go away and get some sleep. Maybe that's all you have left. I'll leave. <b> KIRK </b> We've got to go. <b> NINA </b> Will you just listen to me? This isn't going to be easy. It's not going to be easy. <b> KIRK </b> I know. <b> NINA </b> Look, you look great -- I know you look great. But if you want to have a good time, then let's go get some sleep. Do you want a beer or something? <b> KIRK </b> I don't know what to tell them. <b> INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY </b> As Kirk and Nina go down the hall, he keeps holding his eyes. Nina is still in her bedroom. After a few moments he goes to the stairs and quietly shuts the door. Nina stares at him a moment. Then she goes to the door. She tries the handle. It's locked. She tries again. It's unlocked. She tries the key. But it's locked. <b> INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS </b> Kirk opens the door to the living room, grabs his drink and starts for the bedroom. After a few moments, the door opens a crack and Nina looks out. She's just entered the bedroom, the bedroom and the living room. It's dark. The floor is bare. Everything has a weak shine in it, but it's the truth of her. <b> NINA </b> Hello? <b> KIRK </b> Hello? Nina looks a little embarrassed, but doesn't tell him. <b> NINA </b> You slept? <b> KIRK </b> Yeah. 
COMEDY | <b> NINA </b> You were good. <b> KIRK </b> Yes, I was. The first few days were, I don't know, boring. Nina looks relieved. <b> NINA </b> And the last one was cold and unforgiving. You know... <b> KIRK </b> What was I thinking? <b> NINA </b> What? <b> KIRK </b> I don't know. Maybe I didn't really understand anything. She looks at him a moment. <b> NINA </b> You slept? <b> KIRK </b> No. <b> NINA </b> Good. You look really good tonight. <b> KIRK </b> Thanks. <b> NINA </b> I wish I could hug you for tonight. I'll call you tomorrow. <b> KIRK </b> I might. But when I get up, I should get going. <b> NINA </b> Wait till I get in trouble. <b> KIRK </b> Yeah. Whatever. And we'll talk. I think you'll make it work out. <b> NINA </b> You bet. <b> CUT TO: </b> <b>INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - SAME TIME </b> Nina lies still in bed, a damp blanket around her.

Nina starts typing on her laptop, as a guest lounge. <b> DISSOLVE TO: </b> <b>INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - LATER </b> Nina's sitting on the edge of her bed, typing... <b> DISSOLVE TO: </b> <b>INT.
